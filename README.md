# Flask_CV_repo
CV website made with Python Flask

This repo was made to show the technical backend of my current CV website: devattwood.co.uk. 
The website itself was uploaded to AWS via Zappa module, in VS Code. I've taken out the backend scripts for brevity, but below is a list of
Python modules used during the course of creating the project.
