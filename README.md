# Flask_CV_repo
CV website made with Python Flask. Within this app, I used SMTPlib, and Captcha in order for emails to be sent securely via the webpage.

This repo was made to show the technical backend of my previous CV site. 
The website itself was uploaded to AWS via Zappa module, in VS Code. I decided eventually to change my site in order to learn React.
